**Heart Disease Prediction Project**


Project Overview
  This project focuses on analyzing a heart disease dataset to build a predictive model that can classify whether an individual has heart disease based on various features. The dataset includes patient demographics, clinical measurements, and diagnostic features.

Features
  Data Exploration: Understand the data by visualizing distributions and correlations between features.
  Data Preprocessing: Address missing values and apply necessary transformations to prepare the data for analysis.
  Feature Engineering: Normalize and transform features to improve model performance.
  Model Building: Develop and evaluate machine learning models to predict heart disease.
  Visualization: Create plots to showcase data distributions and the effectiveness of the model.
